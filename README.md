# Autecology
Autecology is a storage platform for ecological knowledge rules that are accessible to the wider community. This platform will serve all types of ecologists, and thereby be accessible for both non-computer technical users as for technical use in models and scripting. All experts can contribute to improving and adding knowledge rules in relation to the abiotic environment in a version controlled environment. By sharing this knowledge with each other and making it centrally available we will improve the application of available ecological knowledge.
