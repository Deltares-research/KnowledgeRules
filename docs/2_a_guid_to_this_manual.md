#A guide to this manual

##Introduction
KnowledgeRules is a GitHub storage platform to enable the use of ecological knowledge rules on autecology. This platform contains ways to:
-	store knowledge rules in a standardized format, 
-	visualize the stored knowledge rules,
-	use the stored knowledge rules in scripting (Python) and
-	use the stored knowledge rules in models (e.g. HABITAT).
The KnowledgeRules GitHub can be found at:
https://github.com/Deltares/KnowledgeRules
A knowledge rule is a cause–effect relationship that describe environmental impact based on environmental conditions. When these knowledge rules are linked in a cause-effect chain they can be used to describe the impact on environmental characteristics, society and economics and response (management). In regards to ecology, the cause-effect chains can be used to predict habitat suitability for specific species, specie groups and habitat types. The knowledge rules stored on the KnowledgeRules GitHub have been derived from data, modelling and/or expert knowledge. These knowledge rules have been documented either in scientific papers or reports. By storing them in the KnowledgeRules GitHub these knowledge rules are ready-to-use and come with important metadata on their area of application, author, limitations and caveats.
These knowledge rules have been shared in a GitHub storage platform to encourage a dare-to-share principle in using these knowledge rules, enabling users to contribute new knowledge rules and expand on existing ones. By sharing this knowledge and making it centrally available we hope to accelerate and improve environmental impact analysis. 
GitHub comes with a version-controlled environment, allowing to revert at any time to a previous version. All contributions will thereby be stored.

##How to use this manual

	This manual will provide use when you are interested in the following:
1.	You want to store your obtained autecological knowledge rules in a standard format so that 	you can shared with others.
2.	You are looking to re-use existing autecological knowledge rules in your environmental		assessment.
3.	You want to do a field assessment of what could be likely causes for the presence or absence 	of a specific species or habitat type.
4.	You want to use …
