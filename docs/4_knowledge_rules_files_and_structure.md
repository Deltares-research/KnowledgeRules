#Knowledge rules files and structure

##Purpose



##File format

The knowledge rules in the KnowledgeRules GitHub are stored as a XML file. XML allows for a multidimensional storage format, somewhat similar to a database. Most of the knowledge rules are too complex to store in a two-dimensional table. In addition, knowledge rules can consist of limits, but can also contain response curves or formulas. And with each knowledge rule metadata needs to be stored informing where the rule is based on and where it can be applied. To facilitate all this information, a multidimensional format is needed.
XML is a multidimensional storage format that remains readable with the human eye (non-binary). Based on XML schemaâ€™s the entries in an XML file can be restricted and guided. Thereby it allows for a consistent, but flexible format. 
Within Deltares there is a lot of expertise on the use of XML as it is used to configure FEWS applications. To general ecologists this format might be beginning be novel and complex to grasp.
